1. **Prepare the Enoki Mushrooms:** Wash the enoki mushrooms thoroughly. Cut off the tough root ends. Then, separate the mushrooms into individual strands. You can either slice them finely with a knife or tear them apart by hand. Finally, cut the separated mushrooms in half.

2. **Sauté the Enoki Mushrooms:** Heat 1 large spoon of olive oil in a pan over high heat. Add the prepared enoki mushrooms and stir-fry for about 1.5 minutes until they soften and release their aroma. The goal is to bring out their fragrance before adding them to the egg. After sautéing, remove the enoki mushrooms from the pan and let them cool down to prevent the eggs from cooking prematurely. While cooling, you can continue to stir them to ensure they are separated into individual strands.

3. **Prepare the Egg Mixture:** While the enoki mushrooms are cooling, finely chop some scallions. In a bowl, crack 5 eggs. Add 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1/2 teaspoon of brown sugar, and 1 teaspoon of soy sauce. Lightly beat the eggs; avoid over-mixing, as this can cause the omelette to become watery and less fluffy.

4. **Combine and Fry:** Add the cooled, sautéed enoki mushrooms and chopped scallions to the egg mixture and stir gently. Heat 1.5 large spoons of olive oil in a pan over low heat. Pour the egg and mushroom mixture into the pan. As the bottom sets, gently push the cooked egg from the edges towards the center, allowing the uncooked egg to flow underneath. Continue this motion to ensure even cooking.

5. **Flip and Finish:** Once the omelette is mostly set and the top still has some uncooked egg, and steam is visible through the surface (indicating heat has transferred), it's time to flip. Carefully flip the omelette. Cook the other side for about 2 minutes on low heat. If the omelette is thick, you might want to flip it once more for 30 seconds to ensure it's cooked through.

6. **Serve:** Once cooked, remove the omelette from the pan and cut it into desired pieces. Serve immediately.
